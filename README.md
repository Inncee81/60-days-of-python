60 Days of Coding
==================

A Poor Man's Programming Boot-Camp
---

Inspired by http://benlevy.com/blog/100-days-coding/.


**Concept**:   
During a 60 day period, work your way through a list of projects in a programming language of your choice. Create at least one GitHub commit per day.  
The idea is to get a lot of code exposure in a structured way during a relatively short amount of time and come out of the experience with something to show for it much like all the (paid) programming boot-camps that have been popping up in various countries (mainly USA though).  
Utilize Test-Driven Development from the start and get feedback on http://codereview.stackexchange.com and the IRC to keep it educational.

**Planning**:  
Time frame will be 21.03.2014 - 20.05.2014.  
Language will be Python. Second iteration will be Java with maybe some C and Haskell thrown in.  

A sensible goal might be 3 days per project:
  * Day 1: Conceptual design
  * Day 2: Most of the coding
  * Day 3: Refactorization and Documentation  
  
Thus, the outcome should be around 20 projects.  

**Projects**:  
List coming soon. Projects will likely be picked from https://github.com/mikar/projects or similar sources.  
Currently aiming for ~8 webbased, ~8 heavy OOP, 1 game, 1 fileops, 1 networking, 1 multimedia.  

Preliminary list:  
  * Website, Blog, Forum with Flask, probably hosted on GAE (Web)
  * To-Do-List, PDF Generator or Name Scrambler Webapp (Web)
  * Web Crawler (Web)
  * Address Book (Database)
  * TV Show Tracker (Database)
  * IRC Bot (Network)
  * Mail Checker, Port Scanner, FTP Client (Network)
  * Hangman, Frogger, Chess (Game)
  * Text Editor (GUI, Files)
  * Calculator (GUI, Math)
  * Unit Converter (Math, OOP)
  * Fortune Teller
  * Guestbook/Journal
  
More to come, mainly regarding project ideas and planning.  
Cheers!
