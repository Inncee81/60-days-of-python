100-days-of-coding
==================

Private Programming Boot-Camp!

Inspired by http://benlevy.com/blog/100-days-coding/.

Starting on the 1st of April I will try to do at least one commit per day until the end of the 100 day period on July, 10th.
Programming languages will be Python and Java with maybe some C and Haskell on the side.
Projects will mainly be picked from https://github.com/mikar/projects though some exercises from Books, Project Euler or similar sources might make their way into this repo, too. Ideally, I'll find at least one FOSS project i can contribute to while I'm at it.

The idea is to get a lot of exposure in a somewhat structured way and come out of the experience with something to show for it much like all the (paid) coding boot-camps that have been popping up in various countries (mainly USA though).
I might create a roadmap with weekly goals or I might see where my interests take me. Not quite sure yet.

A preliminary checklist:
  * at least one web-based project with a framework like Django or Flask (a personal blog maybe?)
  * collect some SQL database experience
  * lots of OOP projects
  * make a detour into pure functional programming along the way
  * find an open-source project to contribute to even if it's just a couple of commits
  * make some time for refactoring either periodically or towards the end of the 100 days
  * possibly a dive into concurrency
