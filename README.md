100-days-of-coding
==================

Private Programming Boot-Camp!

Inspired by http://benlevy.com/blog/100-days-coding/.

Starting on the 1st of April I will try to do at least one commit per day until the end of the 100 day period on July, 10th.
Programming languages will be Python and Java with maybe some C and Haskell on the side.
Projects will mainly be picked from https://github.com/mikar/projects though some exercises from Books, Project Euler or similar sources might make their way into this repo, too. Ideally, I'll find at least one FOSS project i can contribute to while I'm at it.
