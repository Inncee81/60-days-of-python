100-days-of-coding
==================

A Private Programming Boot-Camp!
---

Inspired by http://benlevy.com/blog/100-days-coding/.


**Concept**:   
During a 100 day period, create at least one GitHub commit per day.  
The idea is to get a lot of code exposure in a structured way during a relatively short amount of time and come out of the experience with something to show for it much like all the (paid) programming boot-camps that have been popping up in various countries (mainly USA though).  

**Planning**:  
Time frame will be 01.04.2014 - 10.07.2014.  
Languages will be Python and Java with maybe some C and Haskell on the side.  
Projects will mainly be picked from https://github.com/mikar/projects though some exercises from Books, Project Euler or similar sources might make their way into this repo, too. Ideally, I'll find at least one FOSS project i can contribute to while I'm at it.  
A sensible goal might be 3 days per project.  
  * Day 1: Conceptual design
  * Day 2: Most of the coding
  * Day 3: Refactorization and Documentation  
  
Adding a fourth day to that cycle as buffer and to dabble in smaller stuff, the outcome should be up to 25 decent projects overall, so i'll update this section soon with a selection of 20-25 interesting project ideas.

**Projects**:  
Soon.  
  
**Preliminary checklist**:  
  * at least one web-based project with a framework like Django or Flask (a personal blog maybe?)
  * collect some SQL database experience
  * lots of OOP projects
  * utilize Test-Driven Development with unittest/JUnit
  * make a detour into pure functional programming along the way
  * find an open-source project to contribute to even if it's just a couple of commits
  * make some time for refactoring either periodically or towards the end of the 100 days
  * possibly a dive into concurrency
  
More to come, mainly regarding project ideas and planning.  
Cheers!
