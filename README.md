60 Days of Coding
==================

A Private Programming Boot-Camp
---

Inspired by http://benlevy.com/blog/100-days-coding/.


**Concept**:   
During a 60 day period, work your way through a list of projects in a programming language of your choice. Create at least one GitHub commit per day.  
The idea is to get a lot of code exposure in a structured way during a relatively short amount of time and come out of the experience with something to show for it much like all the (paid) programming boot-camps that have been popping up in various countries (mainly USA though).  
Use Test-Driven Development and some form of code review (IRC, StackOverflow, StackExchange).

**Planning**:  
Time frame will be 24.03.2014 - 23.05.2014.  
Language will be Python. Second iteration will be Java with maybe some C and Haskell thrown in.  

A sensible goal might be 3 days per project:
  * Day 1: Conceptual design
  * Day 2: Most of the coding
  * Day 3: Refactorization and Documentation  
  
With one additional day as buffer the outcome should be around 15 projects.

**Projects**:  
Semi-final list:  
  * Unit Converter
  * Page Scraper
  * Address Book
  * IRC Bot
  * Calculator (GUI)
  * Text Editor (GUI)
  * Mail Checker, Port Scanner, FTP Client
  * Hangman, Frogger, Chess
  * Website, Blog and Forum with Flask, hosted on GAE (6-7 Days)
  * To-Do-List, PDF Generator, Name Scrambler, Drawing Board (Apps)
  * TV Show Tracker (App?)
  * Fortune Teller (App?)
  * Guestbook/Journal/Notes (App?)
  * optional: IMDB Browser
  * optional: File Browser (Mass Renaming with Simulation)
