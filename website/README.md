Website
==================

Website with Flask and Google AppEngine
---

Address: http://max-demian.appspot.com


**Goal**:   
My very first website. Nope, I haven't even had a HTML site before ;)  
  
The goal is to use Flask to create a website with any or all of these:
	* Blog
	* Forum
	* Multiple Webapps:
		* Drawing Board  and To-Do-List
		* TV Show Tracker
		* Fortune Teller
		* Guestbook/Journal/Notes
		* optional: PDF Generator and Name Scrambler  

As this is a rather big project, this will count as two to three projects, taking between 6 and 10 days.
