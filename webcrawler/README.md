Web Crawler
==================

So, i've cheated a bit with this one as this web crawler is written by Guido Rossum  
but it seemed like a great opportunity to study idiomatic code and some interesting  
new features of Python 3.4.
I modified it to use docopts instead of argparse and am adding some commentary.

You can find the original here: https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/tree/master/crawler

A very basic sketch of a web scraper can be found [here](https://github.com/mikar/60-days-of-code/tree/master/oop/datastructs/scraping)
